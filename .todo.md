# YCM/ycmd
- document `EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS`
- benchmark and try removing the internal data-structure

# ycmd jedi-wrapper
Consider all this bugs

- Is there possible a way to let YCM complete python3? ( Valloric/YouCompleteMe#587 )
- YCM does not see packages from pyenv virtualenv ( Valloric/YouCompleteMe#1388 )
- Add some way to extend the python path in ycmd ( Valloric/YouCompleteMe#609 )

The first one is the easy one, the other two have to be considered carefully.

## ideas
The first idea that come to mind is to use the current python for starting the
jedi server. That way jedi have access to all packages that a virtualenv python
have installed.

We could consider adding an optional parameter to `:YcmCompleter
StartServer [python executable path]` but would be cucumbersome.

quickfix.c: `qf_types` takes an `int` as error identifier. Make an enum??
vim-patch-7.4.600 should we apply it?
vim-patch-7.4.607 maybe should be NA
vim-patch-7.4.609 maybe should be partially applied.
vim-patch-7.4.613 should be easy to apply
vim-patch-7.4.614 test related. Would mean to port the entire test to lua
vim-patch-7.4.616 fix tab insert. modify test too
vim-patch-7.4.617 fix argdo. very simple
vim-patch-7.4.620 should be NA
vim-patch-7.4.623 have to wait on 7.4.593 to be merged
path.c: `vim_ispathsep` takes an int, should take a `char_u`?
path.c: `gen_expand_wildcards` refactor `add_pat`
