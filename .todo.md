# YCM/ycmd
- document `EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS`
- benchmark and try removing the internal data-structure
- `server_state.py` use a named tuple for the fallback scenario instead of plain booleans
- #1282 could be resolved. Wait for vimscript testing to be marged
- `typescript_completer` has a case for `len( completions) > MAX_DETAILED_COMPLETIONS` not tested
- `typescript_completer` do not have test for `_GoToDefinition`

# ycmd jedihttp PR

# ycmd jedi-wrapper
Consider all this bugs

- Is there possible a way to let YCM complete python3? ( Valloric/YouCompleteMe#587 )
- YCM does not see packages from pyenv virtualenv ( Valloric/YouCompleteMe#1388 )
- Add some way to extend the python path in ycmd ( Valloric/YouCompleteMe#609 )

The first one is the easy one, the other two have to be considered carefully.

## ideas
The first idea that come to mind is to use the current python for starting the
jedi server. That way jedi have access to all packages that a virtualenv python
have installed.

We could consider adding an optional parameter to `:YcmCompleter
StartServer [python executable path]` but would be cucumbersome.
